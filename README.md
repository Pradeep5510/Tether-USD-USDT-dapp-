Tether USD USDT-DApp

An educational decentralised application built to simulate the functionalities of a USDT-like stable token, including **minting, burning, transferring**, and **liquidity pool creation** to maintain a $1 price peg.

#Overview

Tether USD USDT-DApp is a blockchain-based decentralised application created for educational and research purposes.  
This project demonstrates how stablecoins function on a blockchain through smart contracts, tokenomics, and Web3 integration.

The project covers every step — from developing and deploying the token smart contract to creating a liquidity pool on a DEX (PancakeSwap) to peg the token’s value at $1 per token.

#Features

#Smart Contract (Solidity)
- ERC20/BEP20-compliant smart contract.
- Custom minting and burning functions.
- Owner-controlled 'forceBurn' mechanism.
- Integrated token decimals and supply scaling.
- Deployed on **BNB Smart Chain (Testnet)**.

# Frontend (React + Ethers.js)
- Modern React-based user interface.
- Wallet connection via **MetaMask**.
- Live wallet address display on navbar.
- Token **mint**, **burn**, and **transfer** functionalities.
- Role-based access (Owner Panel & User Panel).
- Fully responsive with professional UI/UX design.

# Liquidity Pool Integration
- Created a **liquidity pool on PancakeSwap (Testnet)**.
- Pegged EduUSDT price to **$1 (1 USDT)**.
- Verified token contract & visible symbol on wallets.
- Price fetched dynamically from DEX liquidity.

#How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet** — User connects via MetaMask (BNB Testnet).  
2. **Owner Panel** — Allows minting and forced burning of tokens.  
3. **User Panel** — Enables transferring tokens between wallets.  
4. **Liquidity Pool** — Token price pegged to 1 USDT via PancakeSwap.  
5. **UI/UX** — Fully responsive, mobile-ready layout for modern DApp feel.


#Developer Notes

This project was created entirely by **Pradeep Pathak** as part of a **self-learning initiative** to understand:
- Smart contract development & deployment.
- Wallet integration with Web3.
- Liquidity pool creation and price pegging.
- React-based decentralized application architecture.

**Disclaimer:**  
> This project is built **for educational purposes only**.  
> The token, liquidity pool, and contracts are **not intended for commercial use** or financial transactions.
