# Tether USD USDT-DApp

An educational decentralized application built to simulate the functionalities of a **USDT-like stable token**, including **minting, burning, transferring**, and **liquidity pool creation** to maintain a $1 price peg.

---

##  Overview

Tether USD USDT-DApp is a blockchain-based decentralized application created for **educational and research purposes**.  
This project demonstrates how stablecoins function on a blockchain through smart contracts, tokenomics, and Web3 integration.

The project covers every step — from **developing and deploying the token smart contract** to **creating a liquidity pool** on a DEX (PancakeSwap) to peg the token’s value at **$1 per token**.

## ⚙️ Features

### 🧩 Smart Contract (Solidity)
- ERC20/BEP20-compliant smart contract.
- Custom minting and burning functions.
- Owner-controlled `forceBurn` mechanism.
- Integrated token decimals and supply scaling.
- Deployed on **BNB Smart Chain (Testnet)**.

### 🌐 Frontend (React + Ethers.js)
- Modern React-based user interface.
- Wallet connection via **MetaMask**.
- Live wallet address display on navbar.
- Token **mint**, **burn**, and **transfer** functionalities.
- Role-based access (Owner Panel & User Panel).
- Fully responsive with professional UI/UX design.

### 💱 Liquidity Pool Integration
- Created a **liquidity pool on PancakeSwap (Testnet)**.
- Pegged EduUSDT price to **$1 (1 USDT)**.
- Verified token contract & visible symbol on wallets.
- Price fetched dynamically from DEX liquidity.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet** — User connects via MetaMask (BNB Testnet).  
2. **Owner Panel** — Allows minting and forced burning of tokens.  
3. **User Panel** — Enables transferring tokens between wallets.  
4. **Liquidity Pool** — Token price pegged to 1 USDT via PancakeSwap.  
5. **UI/UX** — Fully responsive, mobile-ready layout for modern DApp feel.
